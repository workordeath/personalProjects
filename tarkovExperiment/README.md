INTRODUCTION:
=============

Hello, this program is for an experiment that I wanted to do.
Tarkov keeps track of certain data, how many raids you survive/die.
The amount of rubles you have in your stash, your kill/death ratio.

What I wanted to do was to find just how long it would take me to
get significant improvements in my ruble and kill/death ratio.

And to do so I need to first track that information so this is what
this program essentially does.

===========
HOW TO RUN:
===========

So I ran this program using the codeBlocks Ide.

You have to make a data file as a .txt file, where the .cpp file is located
I named my data file "tarkovDataList.txt"

If you want to change the name of the data file you have to go to the functions
writeToData(), and readFromData().
